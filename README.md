# Ruby File Infection Simulation

## Warning: Potential Harm and Ethical Considerations

- This repository contains code intentionally designed to simulate malware behavior.
- **Running this code on a real system poses significant risks of data loss, system damage, and privacy breaches.**
- **Use this repository exclusively for educational or research purposes within controlled environments.**
- **Never execute this code on systems without explicit authorization and thorough understanding of its potential consequences.**

## Educational Purposes:

- This simulation aims to demonstrate the destructive potential of malware and highlight the importance of secure coding practices.
- It provides a hands-on learning experience for understanding malware propagation and infection techniques.
- **Ethical considerations and responsible usage are paramount throughout any interaction with this repository.**

## Functionality Overview:

- **File Discovery and Conversion:** The code locates files within a specified path and its subdirectories, renaming various files to have a .rb extension.
- **Code Injection:** It injects the contents of a designated "malware.rb" file into the modified .rb files, simulating malware propagation.
- **Disclaimer:** The actual injection of malicious code is intentionally omitted to prevent potential harm and prioritize ethical considerations.

## Usage (For Educational Purposes Only):

1. **Set Up a Safe Environment:**
   - Use a virtual machine or isolated testing environment to prevent any impact on your primary system.
   - Obtain explicit permission for any testing within shared environments.
2. **Review the Code:**
   - Carefully examine the code to understand its functionality and potential risks.
   - Discuss ethical implications and responsible usage with learners or collaborators.
3. **Modify for Simulation:**
   - If necessary, modify the code to inject harmless content instead of actual malware, preserving the educational value without real-world harm.
4. **Execute (If Safe):**
   - Within the safe environment, execute the script using Ruby: `ruby main.rb`
   - Observe its behavior and analyze its simulated impact.
